There are four words describe possession and accompaniment in Talo:
*dem*, *jam*, *gjum*, and *nen*. Each have different shades of meaning,
and different degrees of separation.

Dem

*Dem* is the most basic possession verb. It effectively translates to
*of *in english. *Dem* is used for ownership, as well as interpersonal
relationships (i.e., family or friends).

Jam

*Jam* translates to "have" or "hold" in english. It describes something
that you hold in your hand, or have held recently.

Gjum

*Gjum* shows accompaniment, or something that is *with* you, but you do
not necessarily *own* it. It also shows togetherness.

Nen

*Nen* describes a part of someone or their identity, usually a body part
or a personality trait. However, it should be used sparingly, as who
owns the object will usually be inferable from the context.
